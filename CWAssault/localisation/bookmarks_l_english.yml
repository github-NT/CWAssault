 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Détente (Recomended)"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It is an uneasy time once more in Europe. The collapse of Hitler's third Reich has done nothing to ease the tensions between the Allies and the Soviets. The Paris Peace accords have brought a sudden end to the conflict in Vietnam, though this treaty is only bound by words... An evermore aggresive Soviet Union continues to crack down on protestors in their neighboring sattelite states. With their economy in the gutter, they seek new opportunities in the middle east."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France has been on the road to recovery thanks to a strong economy. However, the Depression has still affected the country and the new German regime has no interest in paying the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, a French marshal famously remarked that it was not peace, but an armistice of 20 years. Those 20 years are now rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It is an uneasy time once more in Europe. The collapse of Hitler's third Reich has done nothing to ease the tensions between the Allies and the Soviets. An armistice has been signed between the North and South Vietnamese, a fragile agreement... An evermore aggresive Soviet Union continues to crack down on protestors in their neighboring sattelite states. With their economy in the gutter, they seek new opportunities in the middle east."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Second World War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "The Road to Tehran"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Dark times have gathered as the Soviet Union has aided the Newly formed Democratic People's Republic of Afghanistan, though the Soviet have found themselves in the same position as the American's a decade earlier. The Iraqi Republic now under Saddam Huseein seeks to exploit the weakend Iran through armed conflict but it seems all fronts have fallen silent. The civil war in Lebanon has quickly escalated with the involvement of Syria and Israel, both seeking influence and to stabilize the nation. "
 ESCALATION_NAME:0 "Escalation"
 ESCALATION_DESC:0 "No one could have forseen the massive assault made by the North Vietnamese in 1968. With the Prauge Spring also in recent memory, the Soviets find themselves in another proxy war in the South Pacific. America's involvement has quickly escalated with more troops being funnled, as well as resentment towards Nixon and his continuation. Right Wing regimes with the help of the CIA have sprung up in Latin America with a few left standing and ones that the CIA intends on destroying..."
 CONFRONTATION_NAME:0 "Confrontation"
 CONFRONTATION_DESC:0 "The Middle East is no stranger to instability and once again it's nations shall change. The Socialists in Afghanistan have successfully overthrown their Western Democratic government in a bloodless coup. And now the fundimentalist Islamic populace seeks change as well. The Iranian people have spoken, the time of the Pahvlavi Dynasty has come to an end! An Islamic Iran shall take the stage as the true Islamic nation of the world! The Chinese, undetered of America's failure in Vietnam, seek to expand their influence in the Southern China Sea. Preparations for war are underway..."
 NORMALIZATION_NAME:0 "Normalization"
 NORMALIZATION_DESC:0 "The oppressive regime of Antonín Novotný has finally come to an end! Czechoslovak reformers are quickly taking power, with their liberal ideas, seek to create a more open society... Socialism with a human face! Alexander Dubček calls it. The Kremlin believes he is a loyal communist who will change ONLY what is necessary... Protests in France are quickly ramping up while the war in Vietnam is escalating beyond comprehension."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Following the success of the assassination of Hafizullah Amin, Babrak Karmal has succeded in his place to please forgien diplomats within the Soviet Union. Through progressive socialist policies installed by Hafizullah, many conservative muslims have taken this opportunity to rebel against their athiest communist overlords!"
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict.

 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."

 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."

 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."

 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side. But there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
 MILLENIUM_DAWN_NAME:0 "Millenium Dawn"
 MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "The future seems bright for once this century... A new millennia shines brightly in the distance but the storms of the past still continue to grow. The Soviet Economy seems to be increasing with Mikahil Gorvachev's new policies. The signs of instability are beginning to show in Yugoslavia, minority groups have protested Serbia's Tight control over Yugoslavia. The United States shall taking it's first steps into the middle east while protests in the Eastern Bloc have sprung up and demand an end to communist rule. The world has changed, The world is changing..."
 TAL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Through the collapse of the Afghani Government and with the Soviet Occupying force seeming to stay indefinately, everyday citizens have taken it upon themselves to take up arms against the invading Communist Athiest menace that seeks to destroy what they love. Under the guise of Islam and the teachings of the prophet Mohammad, these so called 'Mujahideen' fighters seek to unite Afghanistan under one Caliphate and eliminate all Soviet Forces."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Already suffering from a long term illness, Yuri Andropov has ascended the Throne of the Soviet Union and inherited the economic failures Leonid Brezhnev was too incompetant to repair. Soviet Forces in Afghanistan have now encountered something else a force unseen anywhere else... A permanint resistance... These so called 'Mujahideen' or Islamic militants, with the teachings of the Prophet Mohammad will do what is necessary to remove all Soviet Forces from Afghanistan."
 PER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Following the successful abdication of their monarchy, Ruollah Khomeini now finds himself in a difficult situation as the newly appointed Saddam Hussein has taken advantage of the country's instability and unorganized forces and launched a premtive invasion. Though the war has bogged down and it seems no side may be able to salavage anything from this quagmire..."
 IRQ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "With Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr gone from office, his vice president, Saddam Huseein who had already been a popoular figure amonst the Ba'ath party for his attempted assassination of the then Prime Minister of Iraq Adb al-Karim Qasim. Saddam's war in Iran has bogged to unfathomably cruel and slow war of attrition. not a single plot of land has been gained from either side since the start and now Iraq finds itself struggling internally with Kurdish Rebels seeking this stalemate to liberate themselves from the shakles of the Ba'ath party..."
 SOV_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Behind the Democratic Façade and Repbulican Sentiments, The Soviet Union is still a Communist country. Mikhial Gorbachev and his cabinet are increasingly becoming more unpopular as Communist politicians are being voted out of office in many public elections. A stalling economy since the Brezhnev Era coupled with a Fractured alliance with it's sattelite states, leaves the Soviet Union in a percarious state and must do whatever it can to maintain it's sovereignty..."
 ROM_IRON_CURTAIN_DESC:0 "Much is there to envy a man with total control of a nation. Nicolae Ceaușescu: The dictator of Romania; originally from a backwater village west of Bucharest continues his absolute rule with the aid of his secret police who terrorize fellow countrymen and all dissenters. Despite a growing population, industrial economy, and production, the Romanian people endure some of the worst living conditions in Europe."
 ROD_IRON_CURTAIN_DESC:0 "For Rhodesia, the future holds dispare... If white morale collapses, or the army is dissmantled there will be total chaos. Civil war will break out between Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo... And while the whites may escape, the African civilians will die in countless thousands. At least thirteen thousand Rhodesians on both sides have died thus far. That figure could fade into insignificance."
